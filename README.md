# CS4348 Project 3 â€“ B-Tree Index File Manager

## Author
Rayyan Waris

## Description
This project implements a disk-based B-Tree index manager that stores key-value pairs in fixed-size 512-byte blocks. The system supports essential file operations, including insertion, lookup, traversal, and extraction, while enforcing a strict memory limit of 3 in-memory nodes at any time.

Please note: the input.csv file has been included in submission to be used to load, but the test.idx file and output.csv must be generated through the commands.

## Commands

```bash
# Create a new index file
python3 project3.py create test.idx

# Insert a single key-value pair
python3 project3.py insert test.idx 15 100

# Search for a key
python3 project3.py search test.idx 15

# Load key-value pairs from a CSV file (format: key,value)
python3 project3.py load test.idx input.csv

# Print all key-value pairs in order
python3 project3.py print test.idx

# Extract key-value pairs to a CSV file
python3 project3.py extract test.idx output.csv
